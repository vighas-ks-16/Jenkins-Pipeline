### Simple Jenkins Pipeline :

Set up a simple pipeline to ensure the docker slave configuration is running smoothly. 
With Jenkins Master handling scheduling and Worker Nodes managing conflicts, everything's in perfect sync.

### Multi-Stage Multi-Agent Jenkins Pipeline :

Now, this one's where things get interesting! It's a multi-stage pipeline, each stage running on a unique agent. 
Perfect for managing multi-tier applications or those with conflicting dependencies. 
Plus, with multiple Docker containers dedicated to each usage, it's as efficient as it gets.
